| Security Example |
+-------------------+
This example demonstrates WS-Security for Mule using CXF web services.

For more information, refer to 
http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULE3EXAMPLES/WS-Security+Example

+---------------------+
| Running the example |
+---------------------+
First, copy the pre-built application archive (mule-example-security.zip) to 
the application folder ($MULE_HOME/apps) and start Mule. 

Then run the command-line client using the shell script (Unix/Linux) or batch 
file (Windows) provided in this directory.

Tip: If you edit Mule's "conf/log4j.properties" file and set the logging level 
to INFO for org.apache.cxf classes, you will be able to see the SOAP XML of the 
request/response messages in Mule's log file. 

+----------------------+
| Building the example |
+----------------------+
First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable to the location of your Mule server install.

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the
example by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will compile the example
classes, produce an application zip file, and copy everything to $MULE_HOME/apps.
